# Person Generator

This is a Discord bot that generates random people.

# Getting a Bot Token

To get a bot token, go to [discord.com/developer/applications](https://discord.com/developer/applications/). Then, click on the blue "New Application" button. Choose a name for your application. Go to the Bot tab you see on the left. After that, click the Add Bot button on the right. After the popup appears, click "Yes, do it!". Lastly, click the "Copy" button beneath the "Token" label. You now have copied your bot token; don't share this with anyone.

# Usage

If you want to download and use this bot locally, please first make sure you have Git and at least Python 3.8. You'll also need a bot token. After doing those things, please run the following commands anywhere on your system, except replace `{REPLACE_TOKEN_HERE}` with your bot token. These commands only work on Windows 10.
```bash
cd %USERPROFILE%/Documents
git clone https://github.com/C-ffeeStain/PersonGenerator.git
cd PersonGenerator
echo .env BOT_TOKEN={REPLACE_TOKEN_HERE}
py main.py
```
That's it! Now your bot is running in the PersonGenerator folder in your Documents folder.
